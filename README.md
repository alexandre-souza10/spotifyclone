## Project description:
- In this project, a clone of Spotify was developed, a music page, Project Front-End, using HTML. CSS, Java Script and images to make the Front-End of the page.
It is a simple Front-End project, but very functional, fulfilling its intended purpose, and still managing to play music making it a static part, and a more dynamic part.

- The Project has the functionality of showing a static user interface, which allows you to play music according to the chosen artist, and whoever is on the page will dynamically play the music in the music player.
We have a static sidebar, where we show the Playlists, a static start, search and library, the Tornando static, but at the same time functional and dynamic in the part of playing music.

- Below we have a small instructional video, where we show an example of how the Spotify-Clone page works.
